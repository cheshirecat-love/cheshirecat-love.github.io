my personal website :> maddie morelos

after going through the .wavzine application and realizing i needed a portfolio, i decided to just make my own website for portfolio, resume, and fun reasons. i used the Minimaxing template by HTML5 UP, whose included readme is appended below. YAY! :]

The very first responsive site template I ever made on 5grid (then skelJS, then Skel,
and finally Responsive Tools). It's clean, minimal, and so generic you can use it for
pretty much anything.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
